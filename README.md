# EScore
Supplement to the paper: "Breaking the ESG rating divergence: an open geospatial framework for environmental scores" by Rossi et al.

Instructions: 
1) Google Earth Engine script: copy and paste the script into https://code.earthengine.google.com/ and follow the instructions.
2) PyQGIS: this script conducts all the non-GEE/OSM parts of the E-Score inputs derivation.  If the script is to be run/edited in a more advanced editor than QGIS offers, such as Spyder, it must be run in the same Python environment as QGIS.  Alternatively, it can be run in the Python Console in QGIS.

Visual overview of the methodology:
